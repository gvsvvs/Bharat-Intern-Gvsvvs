# Prediction and Classification
This repository contains three tasks of machine learning done as a part of internship program 

1.House Price Prediction 

2.Iris Flower Classification

3.Wine Quality Prediction

The common steps followed are :
-Collecting Data / Loading the data

-Preparing the Data: Data cleaning /preprocessing

-EDA

-Choosing a Model.

-Training the Model.

-Evaluating the Model.

-Parameter Tuning.

-Making Predictions.

Also used an ANNs fro prediction to check/compare the better model which is optimal predictive model.
